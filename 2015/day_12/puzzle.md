Santa's Accounting-Elves need help balancing the books after a recent order. Unfortunately, their accounting software uses a peculiar storage format. That's where you come in.

They have a [JSON](http://json.org/) document which contains a variety of things: arrays (`[1,2,3]`), objects (`{"a":1, "b":2}`), numbers, and strings. Your first job is to simply find all of the *numbers* throughout the document and add them together.

For example:

* `[1,2,3]` and `{"a":2,"b":4}` both have a sum of `6`.
* `[[[3]]]` and `{"a":{"b":4},"c":-1}` both have a sum of `3`.
* `{"a":[-1,1]}` and `[-1,{"a":1}]` both have a sum of `0`.
* `[]` and `{}` both have a sum of `0`.

You will not encounter any strings containing numbers.

What is the *sum of all numbers* in the document?
